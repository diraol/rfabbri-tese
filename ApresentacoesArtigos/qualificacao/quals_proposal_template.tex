    \section{Introduction}
    Ubiquity of human networks since mankind origins.
    Digital traces eases uses and understandings.
    Has been so important that we have a revolution.
    Government art, civil art (MMISSA, MyNSA, Tel√µes, Versinus)
    \subsection{Practical and cientific goals}
    \subsection{Complementary routes and linked data}
    Ontologies and RDF representation of data delivers knowledge representation
    proper for civil uses for the following reasons:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Integration of different instances.
	\item Semantics are integrated to data.
	\item Formal representations for automated reasoning.
	\item Formal representations of conceptualizations, easing qualitative approaches to data.
	\item Standards in use and handled by the W3C.
    \end{itemize}

    These are not the focus of the work, but have been delivered by the candidate~\cite{OPS,OPa,OCD,Ontologiaa,OBS,VBS}.

    Other possibilites envisioned are more linked to traditional approaches to politics and humanities, which were not the focus of the endeavors, only referred to in the delivered articles~\cite{stability,differentiation,versinus,ops}.

    \section{Materials}
    Gmane database, facebook twitter.
    \section{Methods}
    Distribution of activity along time and among participants.
    PCA. Additional measures of symmetry, comparrisson with erdos renyi network. kolmogorov-smirnov, visualization, exposition of the researcher to the networks, exposition of results to the networks.
    \section{Results}

    \subsubsection{Ontologies}
    \subsubsection{Social streaming}
    \subsubsection{Gmane Toolkit}
